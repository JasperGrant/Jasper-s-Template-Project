# Getting started with Jasper's Template Project
This project is a general purpose React project template. 
It will have Tailwind CSS with custom colors, and page 
routing. The goal is to have a ready to use template available
for new projects and to introduce my friends to React. Documentation
will also be a priority.

# Before you start
Run the following commands:
#### npm install react-router-dom

#### npm install -D tailwindcss
